Yes, for the first time in India the Swedish \'ambidjent\' band performing live only at Saarang.  Their music is characterized by harmonic minor riffs that will set the ambience with layers of reverberant guitars.  Ambidjent is a genre the band has created for itself with its truly original and unique sound. The band has often been compared to the likes of Mesuggah and TesseracT and have been critically acclaimed as the band that pushes the boundaries of Djent both in texture and sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fresh from the success of songs like Shiver, Dagger and many more, the band promises to deliver one of the greatest nights this country has ever seen!
Vildhjarta means \'wild hearts\' in Swedish. A truly apt name for the band and for this show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

<vishal>Saarang 2012 is proud to present Vishal and Shekhar, one of the leading music director duo of Bollywood, live in concert. Rising to  prominence with Jhankaar Beats which included the hit song "Tu Aashiqui Hai", they\'ve recently achieved tremendous popularity by combining traditional Bollywood music and techno sounds, like in the case of the international rage, \"Chammak Challo\"!
Apart from being excellent music composers, both Vishal and Shekhar have repeatedly shown their individual singing prowess. Vishal & Shekhar will be the pioneers in a live audio show which may put them in the Guinness Book of World Records. Having recently worked with international artistes like Akon and Imogen Heap, Vishal & Shekhar are already leaving their mark in the music industry not only in India but across the world as well!
The most striking fact about them, though, is their incredible stage presence. Chennai, for the very first time, is all set to witness a performance that is sure to rock audiences on the 22nd of January, 2012, at the Open Air Theatre! Trust us, you do not want to miss this mind blowing experience at any cost!
