<info>Set in a lush green campus spanning 620 acres in the heart of Chennai, IIT Madras is home to 6000 students and also a few hundred monkeys, deer and blackbuck. Carved from the Guindy National Park, the IITM which celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2009, is blessed with rich wildlife that perhaps no other college in the world can boast of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
IIT Madras boasts one of the most vibrant student population in India with it\'s eclectic mix of students taking part in a variety of events on campus ranging from quizzing to hosting and excelling in technical events. Cultural activities on campus reach its peak in January as Saarang fever takes over the campus. Formerly known as Mardi Gras, Saarang has, over the years, evolved into the behemoth it is today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
IITM being a residential campus has 17 hostels all of which are named after rivers.  This along with the fact that the campus buses used to be named after mountains has resulted in an epigram about IIT Madras that it is the only place where the mountains move and the rivers remain still.&lt;br/&gt;
Another distinctive feature of the campus is its lingo. A mix of English, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam and Tamil, aspects of the campus slang has been adopted by some other Chennai colleges. Interestingly enough, the lingo has outgrown the boundaries of the college and has resulted in a Master\'s thesis about it in a German university.
