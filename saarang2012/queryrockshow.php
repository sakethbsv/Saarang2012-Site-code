Yes, for the first time in India the Swedish \'ambidjent\' band performing live only at Saarang.  Their music is characterized by harmonic minor riffs that will set the ambience with layers of reverberant guitars.  Ambidjent is a genre the band has created for itself with its truly original and unique sound. The band has often been compared to the likes of Mesuggah and TesseracT and have been critically acclaimed as the band that pushes the boundaries of Djent both in texture and sound.&lt;br /&gt;
