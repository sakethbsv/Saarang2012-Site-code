&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest cultural festivals in the country, Saarang is truly a celebration of all that young India stands for - with culture, colour and mirth running throughout. These four days and five nights of Saarang make for the experience of a lifetime. Saarangâ€™s history runs parallel to that of the institute as it nears forty years of existence, both as Mardi Gras and Saarang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout it has stood for that which, for most of us, makes life truly worth living. This year, it is only set to get bigger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year will see Saarang have a larger festival area, , bigger professional shows and plenty of highlights.The participation base, which largely comprises students and young professionals between the ages of 15 and 35, is sure to see an increase.&lt;br/&gt;We, at Saarang, sincerely believe that Saarang provides our sponsors and partners with the ideal avenue to communicate with this target demographic. All our sponsors and partners will be well represented, with increased visibility for branding and promotional activities and a recall level that simply cannot otherwise be achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Saarang 2011 aims to be bigger and better than ever, we hope to enter into a mutually beneficial relationship with our sponsors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
